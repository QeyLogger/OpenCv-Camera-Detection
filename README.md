# OpenCv-Camera-Detection
This is a small project that I worked on ;  it basically detects your face and create a visual keyboard which you could control with kinetic movement.

To use this python code, you will need to install some modules : 

Numpy : pip install numpy

OpenCv : https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv # Make sure to check whether you have have 32 or 64 bit Os.

Math ( Should be preinstalled ) if not simply : pip install Math.


Enjoy, Run the Program.
